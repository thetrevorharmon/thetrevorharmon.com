# thetrevorharmon.com

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ This is the repo for my blog & portfolio site. It's built on [Gatsby](https://gatsby.org) and written in Typescript, with the styling done in SASS modules. The data is pulled from local markdown files. The site is hosted on Netlify. ðŸ’ª

## Getting Started

Getting started with this repo is fairly straightforward:

1. Go to Mailchimp, and Google Analytics to find all the necessary pieces for your .env file.
2. Create two .env files: `.env.development` and `.env.production`. You can refer to `.env.sample` to know what you need to find.
3. Run `yarn install`.
4. Run `yarn start`.

That's it!
