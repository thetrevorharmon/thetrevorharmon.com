# thetrevorharmon.com

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ This is the repo for my blog & portfolio site. It's built on [Gatsby](https://gatsby.org) and written in Typescript, with the styling done in SASS modules. The data is pulled from local markdown files. The site is hosted on Netlify. ðŸ’ª

## Getting Started

Getting started with this repo is easy:
