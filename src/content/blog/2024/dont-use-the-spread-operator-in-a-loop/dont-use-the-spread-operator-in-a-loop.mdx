I recently stumbled on [this article](https://jpcamara.com/2023/03/07/making-tanstack-table.html) that talks about a one line change that had a huge performance boost. The change? Removing the spread operator from within a loop.

I have regularly reached for the spread operator without too much thought, since it plays very nicely with an immutable style of JS programming[^const_isnt_constant]. However, after reading the article, I decided to do some digging into the performance of the operator. Pretty quickly it becomes apparent that the spread operator essentially runs in `O(n)` time. Used one time, this isn't so badâ€“but when you start to use it within loops, it gets pretty bad. Take this example:

```tsx
const users = [
  {firstName: 'Alice', lastName: 'Church', age: 32},
  {firstName: 'Bob', lastName: 'Lloyd', age: 55},
  {name: 'Clarence', lastName: 'Tyson', age: 24},
];

const formattedUsers = users.map((user) => {
  const fullName = getFullName(user);
  
  const userWithFullName = {...user, fullName};

  const createdAt = new Date();

  const userWithCreationTime = {...userWithFullName, createdAt};

  return userWithCreationTime;
});
```

I separated the creation of `userWithFullName` from `userWithCreationTime` because I have seen kind of approach before (and have done it myself!). When my eyes scan this code, I think "one loop, no big deal, `O(n)`". But in reality, since there are two uses of the spread operator, it's `O(2n^2)` ðŸ˜¬ 

One fix would be to combine the two objects in one:

```tsx
const formattedUsers = users.map((user) => {
  const fullName = getFullName(user);
  const createdAt = new Date();
  
  return {
    ...user,
    fullName,
    createdAt
  }
});
```
That is certainly an improvement, as it reduces the time to `O(n^2)`. But the best solution here in my opinion is to embrace mutability[^mutability_in_js]:
```tsx
const formattedUsers = users.map((user) => {
  user.fullName = getFullName(user);
  user.createdAt = new Date();
  
  return user;
});
```
The new solution is `O(n)`.

If you can help it, don't use the spread operator in a loop.

[^const_isnt_constant]: "Immutable" is used loosely here since [`const` is not really immutable](/blog/const-isnt-constant/).
[^mutability_in_js]: I realize that this isn't a cure-all; embracing mutability isn't appropriate in every situation. I recommend applying this approach judiciously.
