<Callout>**tl;dr:** `value == null` is an easy way to capture both `null` and `undefined` in a equality check, and it's the one clear case that a loose equality check is better than a strict equality check.</Callout>

By default, I always use strict equality checks when writing JavaScript. There are plenty of articles and StackOverflow answers explaining why you should use strict equality (`===`) instead of loose equality (`==`). For just about every case, I agree that strict equality checks are the way to go–except when working with null values.

## Two ways to express null

One of the quirks of JavaScript is that there are two ways to express a null or "nothing" value–`null` and `undefined`. Though similar, these two values aren't exactly the same:

- `undefined` indicates that there was nothing set or returned by a function. If you declare a variable without setting it to a value (e.g. `let myVariable;`), by default it has a value of `undefined`. I have observed that JavaScript _mostly_ uses `undefined` in functions as the "none" value (though, in true JavaScript fashion, there are exceptions to this, like in the [`exec()` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec) of the regular expression object).
- `null` indicates the intentional absence of a value. For example, in a getter function, you might return `null` if the value is not found.

I have often seen these two used interchangably, despite them not being _quite_ the same. My rule of thumb is to use `null` as much as possible, because it is a clearer (but not perfect) indication that the code returning the `null` was written by a human.

## Handling both values with one check

Since both of these values exist in JavaScript, we need to accomodate each one in conditionals. Sometimes in the name of "always doing strict checks", I will see the following code:

```ts
if (value === undefined || value === null) {
  // ...
}
```

This code is totally correct! But there is a simpler, more elegant way:

```ts
if (value == null) {
  // ...
}
```

This works because both `null` and `undefined` are [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy), and are equivalent to each other in a loose check–you can see this for yourself if you run the following in the browser console:

```ts
console.log(null == undefined);
```

That logs out `true`! [The MDN docs on `null`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/null#difference_between_null_and_undefined) give a complete explanation of how `null` and `undefined` resolve in various types of checks.

I find that using a loose `null` check everywhere lets me care less about "which kind of null value is it" and simply check if it is one of the possible null values.

## Practical example

This is really useful in TypeScript when mixing `null` with optional parameters. Imagine you have a `Button` function that optionally takes in an `Icon`. The `icon` prop also accepts `null` so that the consumer can pass in `null` as well:

```ts
interface ButtonProps {
  title: string;
  icon?: Icon | null;
}
```

In this example, the loose equality check comes in handy:

```tsx
function Button({title, icon}: ButtonProps) {
  if (icon == null) {
    return <button>{title}</button>;
  }

  return (
    <button>
      {icon}
      {title}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Loose null checks are simpler, easy to read, are a bit more elegant than checking `null` and `undefined` separately.
