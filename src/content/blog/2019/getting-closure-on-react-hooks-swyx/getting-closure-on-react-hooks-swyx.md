This fantastic talk from JSConf by Shawn Wang (known as [@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx)) explains what's going on in the background with [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html). After watching this, I have a much stronger conceptual model of hooks and an understanding of why [the Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) exist. Definitely would recommend to any React devs using hooks!
