In July 2022 I was tasked with integrating [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net) into [ShopifyQL Notebooks](https://apps.shopify.com/shopifyql-notebooks). I had to discover how to connect our ShopifyQL language server to CodeMirror, which was something that the internet offered very little guidance on. After struggling for many months I finally reached the other side and was able to craft a delightful code editing experience.

I decided to reflect on what I learned during that experience and share about it on the Shopify Engineering blog. This is the first of a few articles where I walk through what I learned in my experience with CodeMirrorâ€“I'll publish the rest of the articles on my own blog in the coming weeks and months.
