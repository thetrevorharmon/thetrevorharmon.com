This album cover was done for Michael Barrow & the Tourist's EP "Something New". This was created as a companion art to ["Sweet Honey"](/projects/sweet-honey-cover-art 'The Sweet Honey album art') and ["Never Stop"](/projects/never-stop-cover-art). I decided to go with a design that would be heavily inspired by the design for "Sweet Honey", and you can read about that process in depth in my article ["The Value of Iterative Design"](/blog/the-value-of-iterative-design 'The blog post explaining the iterations I went through to get to my final design for Sweet Honey').

The client never used this exact design, but took it and modified it to create the final version they used.
